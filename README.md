My Final Project for Grade 10 APCSA, run Main.java to run the program.

Description:
- A platformer game inspired by Celeste, with various different game objects and one large continuous level
- Apart from the visible game elements, I implemented systems such as coyote jump, reduced spike hitbox, wall jump coyote time, jump buffering for better player experience
